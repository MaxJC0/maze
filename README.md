# Maze Project

This project is a maze generator and solver written in Python.

## Features
- Generates random mazes of customizable size
- Plans to implement multiple algorithms to solve the maze
- Will compare the performance and time taken by different solving algorithms

## Usage
Run the maze generator:
```bash
python maze.py
```

## Planned Maze Solvers
- Depth-First Search (DFS)
- Breadth-First Search (BFS)
- A* Search
- Other algorithms for comparison

## Goals
- Visualize generated mazes
- Implement and compare different maze solving strategies
- Measure and display the time taken by each algorithm
